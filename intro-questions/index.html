        <p>1. Anna, Communication Design, Junior </p>
        <p>2. I'm originally from California but grew up in Thailand. I grew up loving art and so I entered Sam Fox as a Studio Art major. 
            However, after freshmen year I grew to like design better so I switched to ComDes. I am now interested in learning more about UX/UI!</p>
        <p>3. We had one lesson on it in Typography 1 but that is it. </p>
        <p>4. I want to learn the backend of UI better in order to create my own websites with more flexablity.</p>
        <p>5. Designing for a screen should be dynamic and read differently from paper. There is a lot more creativity you can implement. 
            You also need to be aware of changes in text style, size, and formating as the screen size changes.
