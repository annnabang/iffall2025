        <p class="section-title">[Verse 1]</p>
        <p>
        They say, "The holy water's watered down<br>
        And this town's lost its faith<br>
        Our colors will fade eventually"<br>
        So, if our time is runnin' out<br>
        Day after day<br>
        We'll make the mundane our masterpiece
        </p>

        <p class="section-title">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
        <p>
        Oh, my, my<br>
        Oh, my, my love<br>
        I take one look at you
        </p>

        <p class="section-title">[Chorus]</p>
        <p>
        You're takin' me out of the ordinary<br>
        I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried<br>
        On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine<br>
        The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found<br>
        Somethin' so out of the ordinary<br>
        You got me kissin' the ground of your sanctuary<br>
        Shatter me with your touch, oh, Lord, return me to dust<br>
        The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
        </p>

        <p class="section-title">[Verse 2]</p>
        <p>
        Hopeless hallelujah<br>
        On this side of Heaven's gate<br>
        Oh, my life, how do ya<br>
        Breathe and take my breath away?<br>
        At your altar, I will pray<br>
        You're the sculptor, I'm the clay
        </p>

        <p class="section-title">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
        <p>
        Oh, my, my
        </p>

        <p class="section-title">[Chorus]</p>
        <p>
        You're takin' me out of the ordinary<br>
        I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried<br>
        On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine<br>
        The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found<br>
        Somethin' so out (Out) of the ordinary (Ordinary)<br>
        You got me kissing the ground (Ground) of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)<br>
        Shatter me with your touch, oh, Lord, return me to dust<br>
        The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
        </p>

        <p class="section-title">[Bridge]</p>
        <p>
        Somethin' so heavenly, higher than ecstasy<br>
        Whenever you're next to me, oh, my, my<br>
        World was in black and white until I saw your light<br>
        I thought you had to die to find
        </p>

        <p class="section-title">[Chorus]</p>
        <p>
        Somethin' so out of the ordinary<br>
        I want you laying me down 'til we're dead and buried<br>
        On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine<br>
        The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found<br>
        Somethin' so out (Out) of the ordinary<br>
        You got me kissing the ground (Ground) of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)<br>
        Shatter me with your touch, oh, Lord, return me to dust<br>
        The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
